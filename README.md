I am a highly motivated and ambitious full stack Software Developer.

After completing my studies and training in Radiography in Italy, I decided to move to the UK to complete a masters degree in Health Informatics. Upon graduating from this, I was particularly interested in  working for NGOs, and so was employed as a Clinical Researcher at Saving Faces, which is a medical research charity dedicated to the reduction of facial injuries and diseases.

I am driven by a keen interest in technology and I decided to join Makers Academy as I believed their curriculum would provide me with the right foundation to pursue a career in software development.  During the course, I have gained the knowledge and abilities to develop software following best-approach practices. I have learnt to work in teams with other coders, and problem solve by sharing our skills and combining ideas. As well as this, I have honed the discipline of coding alone and the tenacity and dedication required in finding solutions.

The course has been satisfyingly intense and an excellently steep learning curve. I am now striving to take my existing skills and experiences and apply them further. I would ideally like to be working in a fast-paced, forward-thinking environment where I could continue learning and  engaging my interests to support current work practices, whilst also being given the opportunity to innovate and progress in new ways.

#### Adaptability

I moved to a different country to pursue my masters degree. I was successful in quickly adapting to a new educational environment, as well as in having to quickly hone my existing language skills and become much more proficient. I graduated with a Distinction, and soon after graduating was hired by Saving Faces. Despite the fact I had never worked in the facial surgery field, I was able to carry out research and understand projects I was tasked with within a week.

#### Teamwork

I am a firm believer in the concept of TEAM (Together Everyone Achieves More). I have had the opportunity of working in very diverse environments where teamwork was key to achieve effective results. I worked in public and private hospital settings where I collaborated with health professionals of any level and radiology consultants to provide care to patients and produce high quality diagnostic imaging. Having also worked in a charity setting as part of a fairly small team, it was necessary to contribute outside of my specific job role often to assist my colleagues in their work; for example, in supporting administrative staff in the organisation of fundraising events or in assisting on research projects which were not under my remit. Furthermore, the structure of the working environment at Makers has meant that I have been developing projects as part of continually changing teams of developers, all with different skillsets. I feel I have therefore honed a good proficiency in this skill, and look forward to applying it further in peer collaboration at my next workplace.

#### Problem solving

In my role at Saving Faces, I assisted with the management of clinical audits. Through a systematic approach aimed at breaking down tasks in manageable parts, I was able to provide both clinical and technical support to stakeholders of different levels, including consultants and data analysts. I find that this method of tackling a large task by segmentation can be applied to many problem solving projects and results in a calmer working practice and more thorough end result. This method also proved to be very effective when applied to solving problems which arose in software development projects throughout my time at Makers.

#### Ability to work under pressure

I am able to understand priorities and perform intensely pressured tasks whilst maintaining a high standard of work. I learnt this skill during my Radiography training in busy A&E departments in Italy, and developed it further during pressured occasions in my masters studies and again during particularly demanding instances in my job at Saving Faces. Whilst I feel I have built a proficiency in this skill, I believe it requires a nuanced adaptation to any new experience, and therefore I am eager to develop it by applying it in my future career.
