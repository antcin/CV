I am a highly motivated and ambitious full stack Software Developer.

After completing my studies and training in Radiography in Italy, I decided to move to the UK to complete a masters degree in Health Informatics. Upon graduating from this, I was particularly interested in  working for NGOs, and so was employed as a Clinical Researcher at Saving Faces, which is a medical research charity dedicated to the reduction of facial injuries and diseases.

I am driven by a keen interest in technology and I decided to join Makers Academy as I believed their curriculum would provide me with the right foundation to pursue a career in software development.  The course has been satisfyingly intense and an excellently steep learning curve. I constantly worked in pairs or groups, which has made me adept at clear communication, reflective listening and adapting to all changes that arise in order to produce the best end result possible. In addition, the TDD methodology has become the core of my programming practice; it has helped make me a more thorough and considered developer. I am now striving to take my existing skills and experiences and apply them further. I would ideally like to be working in a fast-paced, forward-thinking environment where I could continue learning and engaging my interests to support current work practices, whilst also being given the opportunity to innovate and progress in new ways.

#### Adaptability

I moved to a different country to pursue my masters degree. I was successful in quickly adapting to a new educational environment, as well as in having to quickly hone my existing language skills and become much more proficient. I graduated with a Distinction, and soon after graduating was hired by Saving Faces. Despite the fact I had never worked in the facial surgery field, I was able to carry out research and understand projects I was tasked with within a week. At Makers Academy, the projects I was working on and the people I was working with changed constantly, and I had to adapt adequately to each change. I learnt to embrace this flux, as it expanded my learning and in turn improved my coding abilities.

#### Teamwork

I am a firm believer in the concept of TEAM (Together Everyone Achieves More). I worked in public and private hospital settings where I collaborated with health professionals of any level to provide care to patients and produce high quality diagnostic imaging. Having also worked in a charity setting as part of a fairly small team, it was necessary to contribute outside of my specific job role often to assist my colleagues in their work. Furthermore, the structure of the working environment at Makers has meant that I have been developing projects as part of continually changing teams of developers, all with different skillsets. For example, in the final project, my team decided to develop a mobile app using two new technologies. The key to achieving to our end goal was switching pairs within this group of four and ensuring that communication was constantly clear throughout the process. In this way, we all contributed our best abilities to the project whilst simultaneously learning from each other. I feel I have therefore honed a good proficiency in this skill, and look forward to applying it further in peer collaboration at my next workplace.

#### Problem solving

In my role at Saving Faces, I assisted with the management of clinical audits. Through a systematic approach aimed at breaking down tasks in manageable parts, I was able to provide both clinical and technical support to stakeholders of different levels. I find that this method of tackling a large task by segmentation can be applied to many problem solving projects and results in a calmer working practice and more thorough end result. This method also proved to be very effective when applied to solving problems which arose in software development projects throughout my time at Makers. In addition, I found that Agile methodologies worked best when approaching coding problems. In particular, the method of reflective listening helped me properly ingest the tasks at hand and tackle them accurately in pair and team programming scenarios. In addition, the technique of avoiding spending too much time caught up in _meta-problems_ proved to be beneficial to achieving the larger task at hand. 

#### Ability to work under pressure

I am able to understand priorities and perform intensely pressured tasks whilst maintaining a high standard of work. I first learnt this skill during my Radiography training in busy A&E departments in Italy, and developed it further during pressured occasions in my masters studies and again during particularly demanding instances in my job at Saving Faces. In my time at Makers, projects changed constantly and I was keen to complete them in the allotted time. What enhanced my ability to work under this pressure was following XP values; particularly the value of simplicity, and focusing purely on what was required in the task. In addition to this, I strived to apply the value of courage to my work, in being honest if something was not working and not being afraid to adapt to changes that disrupted the path of the project. Whilst I feel I have built a proficiency in this skill, I believe it requires a nuanced adaptation to any new experience, and therefore I am eager to develop it by applying it in my future career.
