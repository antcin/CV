I am a highly motivated and ambitious aspiring Junior Developer.

After completing my studies and training in Radiography in Italy, I decided to move to the UK to complete a masters degree in Health Informatics. Moved by a strong interest in working for NGOs, I was employed after my graduation as a Clinical Researcher at Saving Faces, which is a medical research charity dedicated to the reduction of facial injuries and diseases.

I am now striving to take my existing skills and experiences and apply them further. I am driven by a keen interest in technology and its application to healthcare, and I decided to join Makers Academy as I believe the curriculum will provide me with the right foundation to pursue a career in Digital Health, a sector which I believe holds much potential. During these 12 weeks I am hoping to gain the knowledge and abilities to develop mHealth projects to present to potential employers in this sector. After completing the academy, I would ideally like to be working in a fast-paced, forward-thinking environment where I could continue learning and applying my interests to support current work practices, whilst also being given the opportunity to innovate and progress further.

## Skills

#### Adaptability

I moved to a different country to pursue my masters degree. I was successful in quickly adapting to a new educational environment, as well as in having to quickly hone my existing language skills and become much more proficient. I graduated with a Distinction, and soon after graduating was hired by Saving Faces. Despite the fact I had never worked in the facial surgery field, I was able to carry out research and understand projects I was tasked with within a week.

#### Teamwork

I am a firm believer in the concept of TEAM (Together Everyone Achieves More). I have had the opportunity of working in very diverse environments where teamwork was key to achieve effective results. I worked in public and private hospital settings where I collaborated with health professionals of any level and radiology consultants to provide care to patients and produce high quality diagnostic imaging. Having also worked in a charity setting as part of a fairly small team, it was necessary to contribute outside of my specific job role often to assist my colleagues in their work; for example, in supporting administrative staff in the organisation of fundraising events or in assisting on research projects which were not under my remit. I feel I have therefore honed a good proficiency in this skill, and look forward to applying it further in peer work at the academy.

#### Problem solving

In my role at Saving Faces, I assisted with the management of clinical audits. Through a systematic approach aimed at breaking down tasks in manageable parts, I was able to provide both clinical and technical support to stakeholders of different levels, including consultants and data analysts. I find that this method of tackling a large task by segmentation can be applied to many problem solving projects and results in a calmer working practice and more thorough end result.
